is inspired from [ekzhang.com](https://www.ekzhang.com) and
[csvoss.com](https://csvoss.com)

This website is powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). To develop, run:

## Steps

- once done with changes, format code using :

```
npm run format
```

```
git add .
git commit -m "<commit log>"
```

- push changes to github. This will start the CI-CD pipeline and deploy latest
  version of code using github pages.
